# alphabet-count-bot
A alphabet count bot inspired by Counting

## How this works
You continue saying alphabet in order like

```text
a
b
... 
z
```

But when it reached ended sequel however you add a character to it like you counting a number like this

```text
aa
ab
...
az
ba
bb
bc
...
bz
```

etc.  
If you ruined the chain you will be logged and people can look at who ruined the chain.  
This entire came from snaky's idea and inspired by counting bot

## How to setup

There's 2 types you can host this bot.

- Replit (likely the easiest)
- Others (applies to others that they don't show the files publicly)
